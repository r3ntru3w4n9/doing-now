# Quirks

Quirks is a repository that stores snippets from languages I want to work on.

## What languages are you interested in working on?

I'm only interested in Go, Python, C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Dart.

## Do you know other languages?

Yes. See my [LinkedIn][linkedin] page for a full list of languages I know. I just feel like other languages are not really worth investing in time and mental resources in actually mastering. Instead, I should work on making better technology (architecture, algorithm etc).

## But why are those other languages not included?

Because almost all software technologies (frameworks) have a counterpart library (framework) written in these languages.
For me, a mortal, other languages are not worth deploying time and resources into.

## What does this repository contain?

It contains concepts and features in languages with which I sometimes get confused.
