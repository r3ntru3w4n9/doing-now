# Snippets

Snippets is a repository that stores snippets from languages I want to work on.

## What does this repository contain?

It contains concepts and features, in programming languages (that I use), with which I sometimes get confused.

## What languages are you interested in working on?

I'm only interested in Python and Modern C++/C/CUDA. [Any performant system comes down to algorithms and engineering](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4911818), and programming languages is just a small part of engineering (e.g. less than architecture design). Python and C++ are more than enough to cover my use cases (because I don't enjoy doing frontend).

Personally, I treat all other languages as domain specific and use them from time to time, but those aren't my focus.

## Resources for learning those languages?

See the concepts for [Python](./python/README.md), [Modern C++](./cxx/README.md).

## What do I use Python and C++ for?

üêç Python:

Simple and beautiful, it's **my favorite language**. Besides, it's an awesome glue language that exposes lots of C / C++ libraries, especially in machine learning. Really no alternative. My favorite scripting language.

Usage: prototyping, machine learning, scripting, glue language for C++ libraries, not-so-performant solution for quick and easy tools / services

üõ†Ô∏è Modern C++ (Old C++, C, Cuda):

Complicated but useful. Super fast (bascially the 1x on benchmarks). Preferred when **performance** is needed. Modern C++ is also pleasant to write, except for debugging template errors.

Usage: high performance computing, desktop UI, games, improve Python performance, computing bound CLI tools, performant solution for long running tools / services, any sort of low level stuff

**NOTE** Python and C++ are ubiquitous and don't have a lot of [deficiencies](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/329728/are-design-patterns-frowned-upon). They also don't have very few overalpping use cases.

## Since when do languages of a project matter?

**It doesn't**. [Any performant system comes down to algorithms and engineering](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4911818), and programming languages is just a small part of engineering (e.g. less than architecture design). Users care about the end product, rather than how things are written. Still, some languages are better at certain things than others. For me, I would like the minimum possible to be able to do everything I want to do. This is why I use these.
