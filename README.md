## What languages are you interested in working on?

I'm only interested in Go, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Dart because I love Flutter, Rust because it helped me better with my C++.

## Do you know other languages?

Yes. See my [LinkedIn][linkedin] page for a full list of languages I know.

## But why are those other languages not included?

Because almost all software technologies (frameworks) have a counterpart library (framework) written in these languages.
For me, a mortal, other languages are not worth deploying time and resources into.

## What does this repository contain?

It contains concepts and features in languages with which I sometimes get confused.
