# Quirks

Quirks is a repository that stores snippets from languages I want to work on.

[![format-code](https://github.com/rentruewang/quirks/actions/workflows/format.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rentruewang/quirks/actions/workflows/format.yaml)

## What does this repository contain?

It contains concepts and features, in programming languages (that I use), with which I sometimes get confused.

## What languages are you interested in working on?

I'm only interested in Go, Python, C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and Dart (because of Flutter).

## Do you know other languages?

Yes. See my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rentruewang/) page for a full list of languages I know. I just feel like other languages are not really worth investing in time and mental resources in actually mastering. Instead, I should work on making better technology (architecture, algorithm etc).

## You sure you don't want to add language X?

Because almost all software technologies (frameworks) have a counterpart library (framework) written in these languages.
For a language to be listed here, it has to have a massive and vibrant ecosystem, or a killer application.
After all, why would I want to spend time on a language that'll probably die anyways?
If a language isn't the best solution to something, then for me, a mortal, it's not worth deploying time and resources into.

## Details of Languages that made the list:

- Go: Simple and easy to use, yet fast. Vibrant ecosystem. **Go routines** make it so easy to spawn "threads" and it's perfect for that kind of work.
- Python: Simple yet beautiful, it's **my favorite language**. Besides, it's an awesome glue language that exposes lots of C / C++ libraries, especially in machine learning. Really no alternative.
- C: Simple to use, however quite dangerous. The language is also super fast. I'll use it for small programs where I don't need objects.
- C++: Complicated but useful. Super fast. Preferred when **performance** is needed. Modern C++ is also pleasant to write, except for debugging template errors.
- JavaScript: Really no alternative when **frontend / UI** is concered.
- TypeScript: A better all around JavaScript. Love it.
- Java: Easy to use, and fast (contrary to many's impression, JVM is awesomely fast). Also, has the last mover advantage, and **Java 14+ is just awesome** to write. The only complaint I have regarding this language is its package system, which IMO is a bit too enterprise focused.
- Dart: **Flutter** is its killer application of this language. It also looks just like Java, which means it's simple and intuitive.

## Details of notable languages that will never make the list:

- Rust: Learned it, aced it, loved it. However, enthusiasts are super arrogant, and [no killer application](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/hdqdjd/rust_is_the_wrong_solution_for_almost_everything/), high profile devs are leaving, and would [never kill C++](https://www.quora.com/Will-Rust-replace-C++). Modern C++ also solves a lot of issues of older versions of C++, and I love it. Also, when performance is concered, it's usually a choice between C++ and Java (also memory safe, but easier than Rust), so unfortunately I don't really see a future where Rust will be popular.
- Kotlin: Tried it, however, compared to Java's simplicity, it's complicated. I prefer simplicity. Also, most of its use is in Android, so I don't really need it (I could use Flutter).
- Lua: Fast, efficient, and has an awesome JIT compiler / C interface. However, index starts at 1.

## Details of languages that have a chance to make the list:

- Scala: Has a killer application: Spark. However, it's trying to replace a simple language though (Java), and I prefer simplicity.
- Carbon: Really depends on whether its package manager / ecosystem is good. Since it's just (C++)++ (100% compatible), whether it'll make the list depends on how good it is over modern C++. Will probably kill Rust if it's much better than modern C++ (at least in enterprise, not in the hearts of enthusiasts).
