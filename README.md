## What languages are you interested in working on?

I'm interested in Go, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript. 

## Why am I only interested in Go, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript?

Because almost all software technologies (frameworks) have a counterpart library (framework) written in these languages. And as a mortal, I have to deploy my time and resources efficently, hence the decision to only focus on those languages.

## What does this repository contain?

It contains concepts and features in languages with which I sometimes get confused.
