# Thoughts

- if people are hailing AI as the next big thing, why aren't there AI hexacorns based on AI applications yet? Kuaishou and ByteDance are mainly social apps, which basically classify as Internet companies rather than AI companies despite their brading effort. Nvidia is a hardware company contrast to common belief.
- The argument I'm trying to make here is, the Internet was incepted in 1991, and deep learning started in 2010. Right now in 2021 we are not seeing an "AI bubble" ever with AI companies hitting 100+B valuations. (2000 Yahoo!, Cisco etc). And it's not coming anytime soon. Does that mean no substantial improvement was made? I think so.
- AI currently should stand for analytical intelligence instead of artificial intelligence. Is AI good enough currently? Definitely not. Google search and say Facebook taggings are okay, but they don't make a night and day difference.
- AI needs three things:
    1. The ability to explain themselves to human, and innovate. The ability to be general purpose.
    2. To help people socialize, as a virtual precense or as a training partner.
    3. Being more active and do things on their on own instead of only taking orders.
- Is there an AI platform?
- How can real AI work along today's AI?
- 5G or Wifi6 can empowers today's people to do fast wireless tranmission over the internet that gets rivals traditional fiber-based transmission. Hence, it's 'disruptions' only disrupts things that cannot have a physical wire attached to it. In other words, moving things.
- What if there are only certain kinds of progress in the world?
    1. Realization of something not yet possible by
        1. Replacing existing method with a new technology
        2. Invent a new business model
    2. Improvement of something that is possible in
        1. Bigger scale
        2. Faster speed
        3. Lower cost
        4. More reliability
- According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the term ‘innovation’ can be differentiated into 4 main types:
    1.  product innovation
    2.  process innovation
    3.  marketing innovation
    4.  organizational innovation
- The function of network intelligence is to generate serendipity, which is a major driver of innovation
- When innovation, adaptation, and execution are critical, success is closely related to how the team interacts with outsiders.
