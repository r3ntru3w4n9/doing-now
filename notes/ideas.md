# Thoughts

- if people are hailing AI as the next big thing, why aren't there AI hexacorns based on AI applications yet? Kuaishou and ByteDance are mainly social apps, which basically classify as Internet companies rather than AI companies despite their brading effort. Nvidia is a hardware company contrast to common belief.

- The argument I'm trying to make here is, the Internet was incepted in 1991, and deep learning started in 2010. Right now in 2021 we are not seeing an "AI bubble" ever with AI companies hitting 100+B valuations. (2000 Yahoo!, Cisco etc). And it's not coming anytime soon. Does that mean no substantial improvement was made? I think so.
