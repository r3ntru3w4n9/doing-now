   the battles are ferocious because the stakes are so small
7. last mover advantage: being the last mover in an industry and become monopoly afterwards. even though this may sound like there’s already competition by then, in a sense the last mover is a first mover moving into a very special direction that is yet to be discovered

## Mark Zuckerberg : How to Build the Future

Back in the days almost everything else was on the internet, however, people factors are lacking. You couldn’t easily interact with people on the internet, and couldn’t easily see what others were up to.

He built a website called coursematch and he was fascinated by how people can be so interested in courses other people take.

He built a dozen such things before Facebook finally came along.

He built the first version of Facebook because he and his friends wanted to use it.

They thought someday someone would build a similar company for the world, turned out to be them.

Facebook is different from other projects of his because he kept doing it. Others simply served their purpose, withered and died.

Start with the problem that you want to solve instead of deciding you want to start a company.

The best companies the get built are the ones trying to drive a social change.

People decide that they want to start a company before they even decide what they want to do.

You go through some very hard things along the way and the only thing that keeps one going is the deep belief of what you’re doing is delivering a lot of value for people.

When Yahoo approached him, he wasn’t sure if the company would continue to grow, and do much better than $ 1 billion if he didn’t sell.

Was the future what they want to build so much more meaningful than $ 1 billion?

Communicate is really important.

The key is to build a company focusing on learning as fast as possible. Companies are learning organisms.

In a lot of ways building a company is like taking the scientific method.

The best way to improve is not through management, but by experiments.

When you do stuff well, you don’t have to do crazy things.

News feed came because he observed what people did was clicking around other’s profiles.

When things are working well, you use the qualitative feedback data from your users, and you get to listen to what they want, what problems you go solve. You use intuition to create some ideas, and test those hypotheses by rolling them out to different users. And get more data and so on.

As a CEO you shouldn’t get into a position where you had to do crazy things such as buying oculus for $ 2 billion.

It’s better to make big moves than regret it.

When things are going well, you learn incrementally.

The best way to grow a product is to do it within themselves.

Engineering and community are the best features.

Invest in people who are really talented even if they have no experience.

Focus on talented people.

Everyone has done something.

Give people a lot of opportunities.

Connectivity, get the world on the Internet.

AI, unlock much potential in many domains.

VR, help people be more creative.

Pick something you care about, work on it, but don’t commit until it’s really working. Best companies are mostly made that way.

People who decided upfront they wanted to build a company usually get locked into local maximums.

Facebook was 6-months in when it finally became a company.

In a world that’s changing so quickly, the biggest risk you take is not taking any risks.

## Elon Musk : How to build the future

You don't need to change the world as long as your work is valuable to people, a small good for a large audience is acceptable.

AI is the most important right now but could go wrong.

Genetic research, diseases and works are important.

Brain-machine interface is very useful.

He did not plan to involve in all those things.

5 things Elon Musk thought about:

1. Life on different planets
2. Sustainable energy
3. Internet
4. Genetics
5. AI

You can get a doctrine on many things but ultimately they do not have a practical bearing on the real world.

What can I do that's useful?

Impact is measured in utility delta \* people affected.

Technology does not automatically get better. They get better because smart people work like crazy to make it better.

There are times when something is important enough you do it in spite of fear.

You should feel fear.

Democratized version of AI where no one company can control it all.

AI is not bad, but someone bad can make use of it.

80% of his time **now** is spent on engineering design.

## Elon Musk's Ultimate Advice for Students & College Grads - HOW TO SUCCEED IN LIFE

Try Tesla or Spacex or start a company.

It's easy to start a company, you just get a few like-minded people.

_Don't just follow the trend. You boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and reason up from there. This helps to figure out if something really makes sense or it's just what everyone else's doing. It takes a lot of effort to do so, it's best way to do if you're trying new things._

He started the first company back in 95 because he couldn't get a job at another internet company as there were too few!

When you're young, what do you risk?

_People are not afraid of not being able to live, they are just afraid of failure._

People should be less risk-averse when there is not much at risk.

If we advance knowledge and do things that expand the scale of conciousness we can do things better. That's the way forward.

He wants to be able to think about the future and feel good about that.

If the stakes are high and the thing is important one should just do it anyways.

## Drew Houston : How to build the future

Dropbox was born out of frustration because he and his team couldn't really collaborate.

First company was rejected because of a small market size and he worked part time on it.

He got to meet his co-founder 3 hours before the deadline.

Do something different.

When somethings happends, you have to address the issues.

There is a lot of competition, but do you use them? If no, it's our chance.

One of the biggest early problems is that no-one really has done before, so it's easy to have everyone running in different directions and it may just fall apart. Also, things break really fast.

You should aim for perfection, but you have to recognize that things are big and sit back.

You divide and conquer problems.

Nobody is born a CEO. You have to be able to make smart and fast decisions about business models, competition, and so on.

_Several years from now, what would I wish I am doing?_

**High output management**, **The effects of executives**, **Poor Charles Almanack** recommended.

Everytime you expand, you contract because focus means killing things that you may love.

AARRR - acquisition, activation, revenue, retention, referral

They focused on why no-one is signing up and directly solve it (by referrals). 

## Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell - Animation
