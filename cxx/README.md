## Concepts

- [C++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) introduces many things that you need to master modern C++, especially [resources / ownership](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-resource) and [concurrency](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-concurrency)
- [Ownership in modern C++ means the **responsibility to cleanup**](https://belaycpp.com/2022/03/17/who-owns-the-memory/)
